# ies2xml 

## Overview

`ies2xml` is a fork of  `ies2csv` utility created by `dark-nova` [github](https://github.com/dark-nova/ies2csv). Please refer to the IES2TSVCHANGELOG.md and IES2TSVREADME.md to see their own work

I modified this code with the intention of batch converting Tree Of Savior's .ies files to .xml files

Future update will include batch conversion of .xml files back to .ies files
